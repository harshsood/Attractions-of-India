        <h2 align="center">Languages</h2>
        <p>Languages spoken in India belong to several language families, the major ones being the Indo-Aryan languages spoken by 78.05% 
            of Indians and the Dravidian languages spoken by 19.64% of Indians. Languages spoken by the remaining 2.31% of the population 
            belong to the Austroasiatic, Sino-Tibetan, Tai-Kadai and a few other minor language families and isolates.283 India (780) has 
            the world's second highest number of languages, after Papua New Guinea (839).<br><br>
            Article 343 of the Indian constitution stated that the official language of the Union should become Hindi in Devanagari script 
            instead of the extant English. But this was thought to be a violation of the constitution's guarantee of federalism. Later, a 
            constitutional amendment, The Official Languages Act, 1963, allowed for the continuation of English in the Indian government 
            indefinitely until legislation decides to change it. The form of numerals to be used for the official purposes of the Union 
            were supposed to be the international form of Indian numerals, distinct from the numerals used in most English-speaking countries.
            Despite the misconceptions, Hindi is not the national language of India. The Constitution of India does not give any language 
            the status of national language.<br><br>
            The Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution lists 22 languages, which have been referred to as scheduled languages and given 
            recognition, status and official encouragement. In addition, the Government of India has awarded the distinction of classical 
            language to Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Sanskrit, Tamil and Telugu. Classical language status is given to languages which have a 
            rich heritage and independent nature.<br><br>
            According to the Census of India of 2001, India has 122 major languages and 1599 other languages. However, figures from other 
            sources vary, primarily due to differences in definition of the terms "language" and "dialect". The 2001 Census recorded 30 
            languages which were spoken by more than a million native speakers and 122 which were spoken by more than 10,000 people. Two 
            contact languages have played an important role in the history of India: Persian and English. Persian was the court language 
            during the Mughal period in India. It reigned as an administrative language for several centuries until the era of British 
            colonisation. English continues to be an important language in India. It is used in higher education and in some areas of the 
            Indian government. Hindi, the most commonly spoken language in India today, serves as the lingua franca across much of North and 
            Central India. However, there have been anti-Hindi agitations in South India, most notably in the state of Tamil Nadu and 
            Karnataka. Maharashtra, West Bengal, Assam, Punjab and other non-Hindi regions have also started to voice concerns about Hindi.

        <h1>Prominent languages of India</h1>
        <h3>Regional languages</h3>
        <p>In British India, English was the sole language used for administrative purposes as well as for higher education purposes. 
            When India became independent in 1947, the Indian legislators had the challenge of choosing a language for official 
            communication as well as for communication between different linguistic regions across India.</p>
        <ul type="filled disc">The choices available were:
        <li>Making "Hindi", which a plurality of the people  identified as their native language, the official language.</li>
        <li>Making English, as preferred by non-Hindi speakers, particularly Kannadigas and Tamils, and those from Mizoram and 
            Nagaland, the official language. See also Anti-Hindi agitations.</li>
        <li>Declare both Hindi and English as official languages and each state is given freedom to choose the official language of 
            the state.</li></ul> 
        <p>The Indian constitution, in 1950, declared Hindi in Devanagari script to be the official language of the union. 
            Unless Parliament decided otherwise, the use of English for official purposes was to cease 15 years after the 
            constitution came into effect, i.e. on 26 January 1965. The prospect of the changeover, however, led to much alarm 
            in the non Hindi-speaking areas of India, especially in South India whose native tongues are not related to Hindi. 
            As a result, Parliament enacted the Official Languages Act in 1963, which provided for the continued use of English 
            for official purposes along with Hindi, even after 1965.</p><br>
        <h3>Bengali</h3>
        <p>Native to the Bengal region, comprising the nation of Bangladesh and the states of West Bengal, Tripura and Barak 
            Valley region of Assam. Bengali (also spelt as Bangla: বাংলা) is the sixth most spoken language in the world.
            After the partition of India (1947), refugees from East Pakistan were settled in Tripura, and Jharkhand and the 
            union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. There is also a large number of Bengali-speaking people in 
            Maharashtra and Gujarat where they work as artisans in jewellery industries. Bengali developed from Abahatta, 
            a derivative of Apabhramsha, itself derived from Magadhi Prakrit. The modern Bengali vocabulary contains the 
            vocabulary base from Magadhi Prakrit and Pali, also borrowings & reborrowings from Sanskrit and other major 
            borrowings from Persian, Arabic, Austroasiatic languages and other languages in contact with. Like most Indian 
            languages, Bengali has a number of dialects. It exhibits diglossia, with the literary and standard form differing 
            greatly from the colloquial speech of the regions that identify with the language. Bengali language has developed 
            a rich cultural base spanning art, music, literature and religion. There have been many movements in defence of this 
            language and in 1999 UNESCO declared 21 Feb as the International Mother Language Day in commemoration of the 
            Bengali Language Movement in 1952.</p><br>
        <h3>Marathi</h3>
        <p>Marathi is an Indo-Aryan language. It is the official language and co-official language in Maharashtra and 
            Goa states of Western India respectively, and is one of the official languages of India. There were 83 million 
            speakers in 2011 and 72 million speakers in 2001. Marathi has the third largest number of native speakers 
            in India. Marathi has some of the oldest literature of all modern Indo-Aryan languages, dating from about 1200 
            AD (Mukundraj's Vivek Sindhu from the close of the 12th century). The major dialects of Marathi are Standard 
            Marathi and the Varhadi dialect. There are other related languages such as Khandeshi, Dangi, Vadvali and 
            Samavedi. Malvani Konkani has been heavily influenced by Marathi varieties. Marathi is one of several languages 
            that descend from Maharashtri Prakrit. Further change led to the Apabhraṃśa languages like Old Marathi.<br><br>
            Marathi is the official language of Maharashtra and co-official language in the union territories of Daman 
            and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. In Goa, Konkani is the sole official language; however, Marathi may also 
            be used for all official purposes.<br><br>
            Over a period of many centuries the Marathi language and people came into contact with many other languages 
            and dialects. The primary influence of Prakrit, Maharashtri, Dravidian languages, Apabhraṃśa and Sanskrit is 
            understandable. At least 50% of the words in Marathi are either taken or derived from Sanskrit.[citation 
            needed] Many scholars[who?] claim that Sanskrit has derived many words from Marathi.[citation needed] Marathi 
            has also shared directions, vocabulary and grammar with languages such as Indian Dravidian languages, and 
            foreign languages such as Persian, Arabic, English and a little from Portuguese.</p>
        <h3>Telgu</h3>
        <p>Telugu is the most widely spoken Dravidian language in India and around the world. Telugu is an official 
            language in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Yanam, making it one of the few languages (along with Hindi, 
            Bengali, and Urdu) with official status in more than one state. It is also spoken by a significant number 
            of people in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, 
            Gujarat and by the Sri Lankan Gypsy people. It is one of six languages with classical status in India. 
            Telugu ranks fourth by the number of native speakers in India (81 million in the 2011 Census), 
            fifteenth in the Ethnologue list of most-spoken languages worldwide and is the most widely spoken 
            Dravidian language.</p>
        <h3>Tamil</h3>
        <p>Tamil (also spelt as Thamizh: தமிழ்) is a Dravidian language predominantly spoken in Tamil Nadu, Puduchery and 
            many parts of Sri Lanka. It is also spoken by large minorities in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Kerala, Karnataka, 
            Andhra Pradesh, Malaysia, Singapore, Mauritius and throughout the world. Tamil ranks fifth by the number of native 
            speakers in India (61 million in the 2001 Census[better source needed]) and ranks 20th in the list of most spoken 
            languages.[citation needed] It is one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and was the first Indian language to be 
            declared a classical language by the Government of India in 2004. Tamil is one of the longest surviving classical 
            languages in the world. It has been described as "the only language of contemporary India which is recognisably 
            continuous with a classical past." The two earliest manuscripts from India, acknowledged and registered 
            by UNESCO Memory of the World register in 1997 and 2005, are in Tamil. Tamil is an official language of 
            Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Sri Lanka and Singapore. It is also recognized as
            minority language in Canada, Malaysia, Mauritius and South Africa.</p>
        <h3>Urdu</h3>
        <p>After independence, Modern Standard Urdu, the Persianised register of Hindustani became the national language of 
            Pakistan. During British colonial times, a knowledge of Hindustani or Urdu was a must for officials. Hindustani was 
            made the second language of British Indian Empire after English and considered as the language of administration.[citation 
            needed] The British introduced the use of Roman script for Hindustani as well as other languages. Urdu had 70 million 
            speakers in India (as per the Census of 2001), and, along with Hindi, is one of the 22 officially recognised regional 
            languages of India and also an official language in the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and 
            Telangana that have significant Muslim populations.</p>
        <h3>Gujarati</h3>
        <p>Gujarati is an Indo-Aryan language. It is native to the west Indian region of Gujarat. Gujarati is part of the greater 
            Indo-European language family. Gujarati is descended from Old Gujarati (c. 1100 – 1500 CE), the same source as that of 
            Rajasthani. Gujarati is the chief language in the Indian state of Gujarat. It is also an official language in the union 
            territories of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. According to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), 4.5% of population 
            of India (1.21 billion according to 2011 census) speaks Gujarati. This amounts to 54.6 million speakers in India.</p>
        <h3>Kannada</h3>
        <p>Kannada language is a Dravidian language which branched off from Kannada-Tamil sub group around 500 B.C.E according to the Dravidian 
            scholar Zvelebil. According to the Dravidian scholars Steever and Krishnamurthy, the study of Kannada language is usually divided 
            into three linguistic phases: Old (450–1200 CE), Middle (1200–1700 CE) and Modern (1700–present). The earliest written records 
            are from the 5th century, and the earliest available literature in rich manuscript (Kavirajamarga) is from c. 850. Kannada language 
            has the second oldest written tradition of all vernacular languages of India. Current estimates of the total number of 
            epigraph present in Karnataka range from 25,000 by the scholar Sheldon Pollock to over 30,000 by the Sahitya Akademi, making Karnataka 
            state "one of the most densely inscribed pieces of real estate in the world". According to Garg and Shipely, more than a thousand 
            notable writers have contributed to the wealth of the language.</p> 
        <h3>Malayalam</h3>
        <p>Malayalam has official language status in the state of Kerala and in the union territories of Lakshadweep and Puducherry. It 
            belongs to the Dravidian family of languages and is spoken by some 38 million people. Malayalam is also spoken in the neighboring 
            states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka; with some speakers in the Nilgiris, Kanyakumari and Coimbatore districts of Tamil Nadu, and 
            the Dakshina Kannada and the Kodagu district of Karnataka. Malayalam originated from Middle Tamil (Sen-Tamil) in the 7th century. 
            As Malayalam began to freely borrow words as well as the rules of grammar from Sanskrit, the Grantha alphabet was adopted for 
            writing and came to be known as Arya Eluttu. This developed into the modern Malayalam script.</p>  
        <h3>Odia</h3>
        <p>Odia (formerly spelled Oriya) is the only modern language officially recognized as a classical language from the Indo-Aryan group. 
            Odia is primarily spoken in the Indian state of Odisha and has over 40 million speakers. It was declared as a classical language of 
            ndia in 2014. Native speakers comprise 91.85% of the population in Odisha. Odia is thought to have originated from Udra Prakrit similar 
            to Udra Magadhi, a language spoken in eastern India over 2,500 years ago. The history of Odia language can be divided to Old Odia 
            (3rd century BC −1200 century AD), Early Middle Odia (1200–1400), Middle Odia (1400–1700), Late Middle Odia (1700–1870) and Modern Odia
