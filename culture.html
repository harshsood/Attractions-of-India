        <h2 align="center">Culture</h2>                 
    <p>Indian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years. During the Vedic period (c. 1700 – c. 500 BCE), the foundations of 
        Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, 
        such as dhárma, kárma, yóga, and mokṣa, were established. India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, 
        Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions. The predominant religion, Hinduism, 
        has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads, the Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti 
        movement, and by Buddhist philosophy.</p>
    <h3>Art and architecture</h3>
    <p>Much of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of Mughal architecture, and South Indian architecture, 
        blends ancient local traditions with imported styles. Vernacular architecture is also highly regional in it flavours. 
        Vastu shastra, literally "science of construction" or "architecture" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan, explores how the laws 
        of nature affect human dwellings; it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic 
        constructs. As applied in Hindu temple architecture, it is influenced by the Shilpa Shastras, a series of foundational 
        texts whose basic mythological form is the Vastu-Purusha mandala, a square that embodied the "absolute". The Taj Mahal, 
        built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been described in the 
        UNESCO World Heritage List as "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the 
        world's heritage". Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on 
        Indo-Islamic architecture.</p> 
    <h3>Literature</h3>
    <p>The earliest literature in India, composed between 1500 BCE and 1200 CE, was in the Sanskrit language. Major works of 
        Sanskrit literature include the Rigveda (c. 1500 BCE–1200 BCE), the epics:Mahābhārata (c. 400 BCE–400 CE) and the 
        Ramayana (c. 300 BCE and later); Abhijñānaśākuntalam (The Recognition of Śakuntalā, and other dramas of Kālidāsa 
        (c. 5th century CE) and Mahākāvya poetry. In Tamil literature, Sangam Literature (c 600 BCE–300 BCE) consisting of 
        2,381 poems, composed by 473 poets, is the earliest work. From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India's literary 
        traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets such as Kabīr, 
        Tulsīdās, and Guru Nānak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as 
        a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions. In the 19th century, 
        Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian 
        literature was influenced by the works of Bengali poet and novelist Rabindranath Tagore, who was a recipient of the 
        Nobel Prize in Literature.</p>
    <h3>Performing arts</h3>
    <p>Indian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. Classical music encompasses two genres and their 
        various folk offshoots: the northern Hindustani and southern Carnatic schools. Regionalised popular forms 
        include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a well-known form of the latter. Indian 
        dance also features diverse folk and classical forms. Among the better-known folk dances are the bhangra of Punjab, 
        the bihu of Assam, the Jhumair and chhau of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, garba and dandiya of Gujarat, ghoomar 
        of Rajasthan, and the lavani of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, 
        have been accorded classical dance status by India's National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama. These are: 
        bharatanatyam of the state of Tamil Nadu, kathak of Uttar Pradesh, kathakali and mohiniyattam of Kerala, kuchipudi 
        of Andhra Pradesh, manipuri of Manipur, odissi of Odisha, and the sattriya of Assam. Theatre in India melds 
        music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue. Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from 
        medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes the bhavai of Gujarat, the jatra of West 
        Bengal, the nautanki and ramlila of North India, tamasha of Maharashtra, burrakatha of Andhra Pradesh, terukkuttu 
        of Tamil Nadu, and the yakshagana of Karnataka. India has a theatre training institute NSD that is situated at New 
        Delhi It is an autonomous organisation under the Ministry of Culture, Government of India.</p>
    <h3>Motion pictures, television</h3>
    <p>The Indian film industry produces the world's most-watched cinema. Established regional cinematic traditions 
        exist in the Assamese, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, 
        and Telugu languages. South Indian cinema attracts more than 75% of national film revenue.<br><br> 
        Television broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of communication and had slow expansion 
        for more than two decades. The state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s and, since then, 
        satellite channels have increasingly shaped the popular culture of Indian society. Today, television is the 
        most penetrative media in India; industry estimates indicate that as of 2012 there are over 554 million 
        TV consumers, 462 million with satellite and/or cable connections, compared to other forms of mass media such 
        as press (350 million), radio (156 million) or internet (37 million).</p> 
    <h3>Cuisine</h3>
    <p>Indian cuisine encompasses a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines, often depending on a particular 
        state (such as Maharashtrian cuisine). Staple foods of Indian cuisine include pearl millet (ISO: bājra), 
        rice, whole-wheat flour (aṭṭa), and a variety of lentils, such as masoor (most often red lentils), toor 
        (pigeon peas), urad (black gram), and mong (mung beans). Lentils may be used whole, dehusked—for example, 
        dhuli moong or dhuli urad—or split. Split lentils, or dal, are used extensively.[315] The spice trade between 
        India and Europe is often cited by historians as the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery.</p>
    <h3>Society</h3>
    <p>Traditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Indian caste system embodies much 
        of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found in the Indian subcontinent. Social 
        classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis, or "castes". 
        India declared untouchability to be illegal in 1947 and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory 
        laws and social welfare initiatives. At the workplace in urban India and in international or leading 
        Indian companies, the caste related identification has pretty much lost its importance.<br><br> 
        Family values are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational patriarchal joint families have 
        been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas. An overwhelming majority 
        of Indians, with their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other elders in the family.
        Marriage is thought to be for life, and the divorce rate is extremely low. As of 2001, just 1.6 percent 
        of Indian women were divorced but this figure was rising due to their education and economic independence.
        Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their 
        legal marriageable age. Female infanticide and female foeticide in the country have caused a discrepancy 
        in the sex ratio, as of 2005 it was estimated that there were 50 million more males than females in the 
        nation. However a report from 2011 has shown improvement in the gender ratio. The payment of dowry, 
        although illegal, remains widespread across class lines. Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from 
        bride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws.<br><br>
        Many Indian festivals are religious in origin. The best known include Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, 
        Thai Pongal, Holi, Durga Puja, Eid ul-Fitr, Bakr-Id, Christmas, and Vaisakhi.</p> 
    <h3>Clothing</h3>
    <p>Cotton was domesticated in India by 4000 BCE. Traditional Indian dress varies in colour and style 
        across regions and depends on various factors, including climate and faith. Popular styles of dress 
        include draped garments such as the sari for women and the dhoti or lungi for men. Stitched clothes, 
        such as the shalwar kameez for women and kurta–pyjama combinations or European-style trousers and 
        shirts for men, are also popular.Use of delicate jewellery, modelled on real flowers worn in ancient 
        India, is part of a tradition dating back some 5,000 years; gemstones are also worn in India as 
        talismans.</p>
    <h3>Sports</h3> 
    <p>In India, several traditional indigenous sports remain fairly popular, such as kabaddi, kho kho, pehlwani and gilli-danda. 
        Some of the earliest forms of Asian martial arts, such as kalarippayattu, musti yuddha, silambam, and marma adi, 
        originated in India. Chess, commonly held to have originated in India as chaturaṅga, is regaining widespread popularity 
        with the rise in the number of Indian grandmasters. Pachisi, from which parcheesi derives, was played on a giant marble 
        court by Akbar.<br><br>
        The improved results garnered by the Indian Davis Cup team and other Indian tennis players in the 
        early 2010s have made tennis increasingly popular in the country. India has a comparatively strong 
        presence in shooting sports, and has won several medals at the Olympics, the World Shooting 
        Championships, and the Commonwealth Games. Other sports in which Indians have succeeded 
        internationally include badminton (Saina Nehwal and P V Sindhu are two of the top-ranked 
        female badminton players in the world), boxing, and wrestling. Football is popular in West Bengal, 
        Goa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and the north-eastern states.<br><br>
        Cricket is the most popular sport in India. The national cricket team won the 1983 and 2011 
        Cricket World Cup events, the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, shared the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy 
        with Sri Lanka, and won the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. Cricket in India is administered by the 
        Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI); major domestic competitions include the Indian 
        Premier League, which is the most-watched cricket league in the world and ranks sixth among all 
        sports leagues.<br><br>
        India has hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events: the 1951 and 1982 Asian Games; 
        the 1987, 1996, and 2011 Cricket World Cup tournaments; the 2003 Afro-Asian Games; the 2006 ICC 
        Champions Trophy; the 2010 Hockey World Cup; the 2010 Commonwealth Games; and the 2017 FIFA U-17 
        World Cup. Major international sporting events held annually in India include the Chennai Open, the 
        Mumbai Marathon, the Delhi Half Marathon, and the Indian Masters. The first Formula 1 Indian Grand 
        Prix featured in late 2011 but has been discontinued from the F1 season calendar since 2014. 
        India has traditionally been the dominant country at the South Asian Games. An example of this 
        dominance is the basketball competition where the Indian team won three out of four tournaments to 
        date.</p>
