        Badrinath (Uttarakhand). This holy shrine of Lord Vishnu forms a part of the four holiest sites (Char Dhams) in Hindu

        one of the 108 temples dedicated to Lord Vishnu (Divya Desams), which find mention in the works of Tamil saints who 
        existed from 6th to 9th century.The ancient abode of Lord Vishnu can be visited only between April to November as in 
        the rest of the months the weather is too harsh for undertaking a pilgrimage journey. Two of the famous festivals related 
         to the temple are –<br>
        Mata Murti-Ka-Mela – in which the mother of Lord Badrinath is worshipped and it takes place in the month of September.<br>

             constructed in the 13th century by a king called Narasimhadeva. Like with most things in India, this temple too has 
            connections with a few legends. As per one of the legends, God Krishna cursed, one of his own sons with leprosy. To 
            seek penance, Samba worshiped Lord Sun (Surya) for a period of twelve years. Pleased with his devotion, Surya healed 
            him. Samba made the Sun temple in return to express his gratitude.The mesmerizing beauty of the place was best summed 
            up by the Rabindranath Tagore through these words: ‘Here the language of stone surpasses the language of man.’</p>
            <li>Brihadeeswara Temple</li>
                <img src="C:\Users\Harsh Sood\Desktop\Saved Pictures\Brihadeeswara-Temple.jpg"> 
            <p>Also known as Peruvudaiyar Kovil and RajaRajeswaram, this 11th century temple was built by the Chola emperor Raja 
                Raja Chola I. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, Brihadeeswara temple is the largest temple in India that is situated at Thanjavur 
                city of Tamil Nadu.<br>
                Cholas are known for their majestic and splendid scale of structures. The opulence and artistic 
                proficiency of Cholas is well reflected in the grand and magnificent architecture of the temple. Made entirely of granite 
                stone, it was built as per the principles of Vaastu Shastras and Agamas.<br>
                The most remarkable thing related to the architecture of this UNESCO World Heritage Site is that it doesn’t leave any shadow 
                on the ground at the noon time. The 
                millenary celebrations of its construction took place in 2010 amid many enthusiastic and grand cultural events.</p>

                    and Shreemad Bhagvat. Som refers to the ‘Moon God’, thus Somnath means ‘Protector of the Moon God’. According to a 
                    legend, Som got the temple built in the honor of Lord Shiva as it was Shiva who cured the illness, which was inflicted 
                    on him due to his father-in-law’s curse.<br>

                    Prabhas Kshetra in Saurashtra (Gujarat). Prabhas Kshetra is also the region in which, it is believed that, Lord Krishna 
                    left his mortal body.<br>
                    Another interesting thing about the place is that it is built on the shore of Arabian Sea and in between the temple 
                    and the South Pole, in a straight line there is no land area. Somnath temple was destroyed and re-built many times. 
                    The place also has a Somnath museum, Junagadh gate, beach and a sound and light show to amuse the pilgrims.</p>

                        surface. One can make use of a pony or manchan to simplify the journey.<br>
                        Surrounded by the glaciers and snow-covered peaks and standing at a height of 3,583 m, the temple is closed during 
                        winters due to severe cold conditions. Even the idol of Lord Shiva is shifted to Ukhimath and worshiped there 
                        throughout the 5/6 months for which the extreme conditions prevail.</p>

                            <img src="C:\Users\Harsh Sood\Desktop\Saved Pictures\sanchi stupa.jpg">
                        <p>Sanchi is a village in the Raisen district of Madhya Pradesh, which is a home to several Buddhist structures built

                            of Buddha.<br>
                            A UNESCO World Heritage Site – This famous pilgrimage site in India was built by the great emperor Asoka in the 3rd 
                            century BC. There are four intricately designed gateways surrounding the Stupa known as Toranas, each individually 
                            symbolizing the four emotions of love, peace, courage and trust. The Great Stupa is 16 meters high and 37 meters in

                            <li>Ramanathaswamy (Rameshwaram) Temple</li>
                                <img src="C:\Users\Harsh Sood\Desktop\Saved Pictures\Rameshwaram temple.jpg">
                            <p>Rameshwaram or Rameswaram is a small island town in Tamil Nadu and is one of the four holiest pilgrimage

                                The reason for its being so sacred is the belief that Lord Rama along with his wife Sita first landed on 
                                its shore after defeating the demon Ravana (who was also a Brahmin). To seek atonement for killing a 
                                Brahmin, Rama wanted to pray to Shiva. Hanuman was sent off to Kailash to bring an idol of the God. In the 
                                mean time, Sita made a small lingam. The one made by Sita is called Ramalingam and one brought by Hanuman 
                                is called Vishwalingam.<br>
                                As per the instructions of Lord Rama, Vishwalingam is worshiped before the Ramalingam, even today</p>

                                    Due to the strong faith of the people, every year millions of them come to take the blessings of Maa 
                                    Vaishno Devi. It is said that it is Maa Vaishno who decides her visitors. It is she who calls her
